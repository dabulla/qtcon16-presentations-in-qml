* introduction of myself
* one question to the audience
* start story how I came to qml
* joke about bad animations (?)
* history of qml presentation framework
** it was in qtlabs
** obtain via github
** there is an internal SlideViewer from KDAB
* introduce framework itself
** how basic slides can be made
** this is actually the whole code of this slide in a working presentation (except for the code-block)
* 'slick animations' example heatmaps
** [what can I say during this slide?]
** I could have done this animation using videos, but I would have to play and pause it multiple times.
** But videos needed to be rendered anyway, and here I could use parts of my application code.
* You can use party of the applicationcode from your front end/UI
** Discuss a prototype of your application with your stakeholders
* 1,5 yaers ago it was hacky to get 3D in the presentation, now we can use Qt3D
* We can use Charts
* It is still effort to do qml presentations at the time
** they are very powerfull (hopefully I could show that)
** The presentation might have looked better, if it was easier to create. I wanted to show you everything, the other presentations are an example, that usually your presentations can look a bit more streamlined
** If we had better tools and more classes and tools, Qml presentations would be even better
